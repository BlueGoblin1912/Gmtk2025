# LoopZ
Hello!! Welcome to my game.
I have never really done this before so it was a really good learning experience for me.

## Loading the game 
The only way that I could find to publish the game due to it being a pygamegame was to get the user to download it directly therefore:
In order to try the game you will
If you wish to try the game its best if you download the LoopZ.zip file and run the main.exe in the code folder or the main.exe shortcut in the root folder.
I really hope you enjoy my game, it has been a real eye opener for me :)
The controls for the game are WASD to move and E to interact with doors/chests. Items which can be used in the hotbar are used by pressing the respectivve number keys (1,2,3,4) certain items can only be used in certain cases (the locekd door or the portal pedistal).
